## Main Objective
We want to perform RNAseq-based analyses on published datasets in order to better understand the interaction between human host and virus.

  <figcaption>Fig.1 - We want to focus on already known genes (such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2) but also on new candidate ones that may play a punctual or a general role in the interaction between host and virus. To this end, we will perform extensive RNAseq analyses as described in the workflow section below</figcaption>

## Deliverables
_Biological:_ Perform a global RNA-Seq analysis with SARS-CoV-2 infected datasets to search for new candidate genes for testing experimentally

_Methodological:_ Create a packaged reproducible pipeline in Docker to help scientists to easily treat their RNA-Seq data and for us if any new dataset comes out

## Projects

We have four main projects going on. To summarize them :

1. SARS-CoV-2 infection global analyses: will include global gene expression, functional and regulation of gene expression analyses.
2. Human-virus interaction analyses : will try to search RNA-binding proteins that might be key in the interaction between human and SARS-CoV-2.
3. Increased risk factors analyses: will look for gene expression data in other datasets to compare especially with selected genes from previous analyses.
4. Subtyping of expression response to drugs after COVID infection: will focus on trying to search for potential drugs that could impact in important genes for the interaction of human and virus.
5. Reporting findings to electronic medical records : will try to make these findings arrive at the hands of clinicians.

Please see the [project](project) folder for details on each individual project.
